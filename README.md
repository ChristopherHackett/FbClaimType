# Facebook Page Claim Type Extension
This project is a Chrome Extension which detects on page mark-up within `<meta>` tags to determine both if and how the web page has been claimed for the purposes of Facebook Domain Insights. The aim is to not only provide this information on a page by page basis in real time but produce summary statistics on how the collection of pages the user visits have claimed their domains. *Optionally* anonymised statistics could be submitted. 

## Getting started

2.	Clone the repo 

        git clone git://github.com/ChristopherHackett/FbClaimType.git

3.	Load the extension for source 

	a.  Grab Icon -> Tools -> Extensions 
	
	b.  Click  `Load unpacked extension...`
	
	c.  Specify the path to the `./plugin` folder of the repo in step 2.
